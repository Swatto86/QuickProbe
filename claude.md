# QuickProbe Development Guidelines

## Hard Requirements

### Code Quality
- **Neat and tidy**: Keep the codebase clean, organized, and consistent
- **Maintainable**: Write clear, understandable code that others can easily work with
- **Extensible**: Design for future growth and feature additions

### Production Standards
- All code must be **production-ready**
- Must compile without errors or warnings
- No placeholder code, demo code, or incomplete implementations

### Documentation
- Include in-code commentary where necessary
- Comments should explain **why**, not just **what**
- Keep comments concise and relevant

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Rust (Tauri)
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: WebdriverIO (E2E)

## Best Practices
- Follow Rust and JavaScript idioms
- Handle errors explicitly
- Validate inputs defensively
- Keep functions focused and testable
