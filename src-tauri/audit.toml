# Configuration for cargo-audit security checks
# This file allows the security audit to ignore certain types of warnings
# that are not critical security vulnerabilities.

[advisories]
# Ignore advisories for crates that are unmaintained
# These are typically transitive dependencies through frameworks like Tauri
# and don't pose immediate security risks

# We still want to see them, but they shouldn't block CI

# Don't fail the build on unsound code warnings
# These should be reviewed but may not be exploitable
